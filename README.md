# LED_Flash

This is a simple arduino sketch used to flash a strip of LED lights at specific frequencies.

The motivation for this came from an NPR podcast I heard on a roadtrip:

This podcast talks about a study (https://www.nature.com/articles/nature20587) where scientists were able to activate the natural brain cleaning mechanism in mice with Alzheimer's disease by simply placing them in a dark room filled with flashing LED lights. What this caused was an increase in the production of the brains immune cells and a decrease in the plaque buildup that is thought to be a leading cause of Alzheimer's disease.

My grandmother suffers from Alzheimer's.

At this point they had not begun human trials, but it seemed like a fairly simple set-up. So I programmed the arduino to flash lights at a certain frequency and asked my grandfather to turn it on in the room during their nightly Scrabble match.

I don't know if it has had a significant effect, but the chance that it has or will have a positive effect is worth a shot.
